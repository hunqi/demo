//Consider the searching problem:
//Input: A sequence of n numbers A D ha1; a2; : : : ;ani and a value .
//Output: An index i such that  D AOEi or the special value NIL if  does not
//appear in A.
//Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking
//for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that
//your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.
